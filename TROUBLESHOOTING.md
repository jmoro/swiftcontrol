## My Click v2 disconnects after a minute
Check [this](https://github.com/jonasbark/swiftcontrol/issues/68) discussion.

To make your Click V2 work best you should connect it in the Zwift app once each day.
If you don't do that SwiftControl will need to reconnect every minute.

1. Open Zwift app (not the Companion)
2. Log in (subscription not required) and open the device connection screen
3. Connect your Trainer, then connect the Click V2
4. Close the Zwift app again and connect again in SwiftControl

## Remote control is not working - nothing happens
- Try to unpair it from your phone / computer Bluetooth settings, then re-pair it.
- Try restarting the pairing process in SwiftControl
- try restarting Bluetooth on your phone and on the device you want to control
- If your other device is an iOS device, go to Settings > Accessibility > Touch > AssistiveTouch > Pointer Devices > Devices and pair your device. Make sure AssistiveTouch is enabled.
