# Changelog Integration - Summary

## Implementation Complete ✓

All three requirements from the problem statement have been successfully implemented:

### 1. ✓ Changelog screen in the app
- Created `lib/pages/changelog.dart` - A full-screen page displaying all changelog entries
- Accessible via Menu → "Changelog"
- Displays versions, dates, and changes in a clean card-based layout
- Scrollable list showing complete version history

### 2. ✓ Latest entry for Play Store uploads
- Created `scripts/get_latest_changelog.sh` - Bash script to extract latest entry
- Automatically formats output with bullet points
- Usage: `./scripts/get_latest_changelog.sh`
- Output is ready to copy directly to Play Store release notes

### 3. ✓ Changelog dialog on first launch with new version
- Created `lib/widgets/changelog_dialog.dart` - "What's New" dialog
- Automatically shown when app opens with a new version
- Tracks last seen version in SharedPreferences
- Only shows once per version update

## Files Created (8 new files)

### Core Implementation:
1. `lib/utils/changelog.dart` - Changelog parser utility
2. `lib/pages/changelog.dart` - Changelog display page
3. `lib/widgets/changelog_dialog.dart` - What's New dialog widget
4. `scripts/get_latest_changelog.sh` - Play Store extraction script
5. `test/changelog_test.dart` - Unit tests for parser

### Documentation:
6. `scripts/README.md` - Scripts documentation
7. `CHANGELOG_INTEGRATION.md` - Technical implementation details
8. `CHANGELOG_VISUAL_GUIDE.md` - Visual walkthrough with diagrams

## Files Modified (5 files)

1. `lib/pages/requirements.dart` - Added changelog dialog auto-display logic
2. `lib/utils/settings/settings.dart` - Added version tracking methods
3. `lib/widgets/menu.dart` - Added "Changelog" menu item
4. `lib/pages/device.dart` - Updated to use async setApp with await
5. `pubspec.yaml` - Added CHANGELOG.md as bundled asset

## Key Features

### Changelog Parser
- Parses CHANGELOG.md into structured entries
- Extracts version, date, and changes for each entry
- Handles main bullet points and sub-bullet points
- Supports three main methods:
  - `parse()` - Load entire changelog
  - `getLatestEntry()` - Get latest version only
  - `getLatestEntryForPlayStore()` - Format for Play Store

### Version Tracking
- Uses SharedPreferences to store last seen version
- Key: `'last_seen_version'`
- Automatically updated after showing dialog
- Compares with `PackageInfo.version` to detect updates

### User Experience
- Dialog appears automatically on version change
- User can dismiss with "Got it!" button
- Full changelog accessible anytime via menu
- Clean, readable card-based layout

### Developer Experience
- Simple script for Play Store release notes
- Well-tested parser with unit tests
- Comprehensive documentation
- Minimal code changes to existing files

## Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
flutter test test/changelog_test.dart
```

Tests cover:
- Parsing multiple entries
- Handling sub-bullet points
- Empty content edge case
- Single entry edge case
- toString formatting

## Usage Examples

### For End Users:
1. Update app → "What's New" dialog appears automatically
2. Menu → Changelog → View full version history

### For Developers:
1. Edit CHANGELOG.md following existing format
2. Run `./scripts/get_latest_changelog.sh` for Play Store notes
3. Changelog automatically appears in-app after users update

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows the principle of **minimal changes**:
- No external dependencies added
- Uses existing packages (flutter, package_info_plus, shared_preferences)
- Integrates seamlessly with existing menu system
- Leverages existing app structure (Settings, RequirementsPage)
- Follows existing code style and patterns

## Code Quality

- ✓ All code follows Dart conventions
- ✓ Proper error handling (try-catch blocks)
- ✓ Null safety throughout
- ✓ Unit tests included
- ✓ Documentation provided
- ✓ Scripts are executable and tested

## Next Steps

The feature is ready to use. After this PR is merged:
1. Users will see the "What's New" dialog on their next update
2. Developers can use the script for Play Store uploads
3. Users can browse full changelog history in the app
